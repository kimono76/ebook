Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database. Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.

TDD can be described with three simple rules. Do not write any production code until you have first written a test that fails due to the lack of that code. Do not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail—and failing to compile counts as a failure. Do not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

Introduction I'm lazy.  I admit it.  I believe so strongly in being lazy that I'll do almost anything to facilitate even more laziness in the future. For example, if I think there is a slight chance that I will ever have to perform the same set of commands again, I create a shell script then and there.  When I need to do that task again, I lazily execute my script.  If maintenance needs to be performed on a system at 2:00 in the morning, I write a script that does the required work and schedule a job to run it.  Lazy people love to sleep. I also believe in helping people find their inner laziness.  Why?  Because lazy people solve problems.  They eliminate the unnecessary.  They simplify the complex. That's the reason I've written this book. I want to share with you some of my favorite tips and tricks I've used to automate repetitive, monotonous, tedious, and complex tasks.  May they inspire you to be lazy. Before we get started I recommend that you download the shell scripts used in this book by visiting:  http://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/shell-scripts Shell Scripting,

Note Don’t type your password every time. If you’re using an HTTPS URL to push over, the Git server will ask you for your username and password for authentication. By default it will prompt you on the terminal for this information so the server can tell if you’re allowed to push. If you don’t want to type it every single time you push, you can set up a “credential cache.” The simplest is just to keep it in memory for a few minutes, which you can easily set up by running git config --global credential.helper cache.
